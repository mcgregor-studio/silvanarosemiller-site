        "quote": "I had the pleasure of working with Silvana Rose Miller on the reboot of Total Drama Island. It would be difficult to summarize her skills in one short paragraph. Silvana conducts herself with humour and grace even while inside the pressure cooker that is television production. She was able to deftly balance the show’s creative needs while maintaining a laser focus on production’s ethical responsibility to accurately represent historically excluded communities. What I’ve learned from Silvana has made me better at my job, and that is something every employer should welcome to their team. ",
